The method comprises generating a plasma to be used in treating the substrate, wherein the plasma comprises an oxygen containing gas, a halogen containing gas, and a hydrogen containing gas; and treating the substrate by exposing the substrate to the plasma. The doped amorphous carbon mask can be a boron doped amorphous carbon mask or a nitrogen doped amorphous carbon mask. The method can result in a mask removal rate ranging from about 1,000 Ångströms/minute to about 12,000 Ångströms/minute. Further, gases can be applied to the substrate before plasma treatment, after plasma treatment, or both to reduce the amount of defects or pinholes found in the substrate film.

Thereafter, the wafer 31 and the copper film 37 are removed, thereby obtaining the probe 7 whose height is fully secured.  &lt;P&gt;COPYRIGHT: (C)2008,JPO&amp;INPIT         RENESAS TECH CORP          20080717                                                                                                  G01R1/073,H01L21/66

The thin subject can be a thin wire, or thin filament, or thin blade. The thin subject can be applied between the workpiece and carrier pair in association with laser debonding or mechanical debonding to provide well controlled and targeted wedging function to the delaminating temporary adhesive and its adjacent substrate to which it is separating from. The workpiece can be a semiconductor wafer that has been thinned and processed, and the carrier can be a semiconductor non-device wafer or any other rigid substrate such as a glass wafer or panel. The application of a thin subject between the workpiece and carrier during debonding provides the advantage of high throughput and low defect rate.

A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device includes a step of preparing a lead frame in which a plurality of device forming regions are arranged in a matrix, a die bonding step of mounting a semiconductor chip on each device region, a resin sealing step of individually covering each semiconductor chip with a sealing body, and a lead plating step of plating an outer portion of a lead exposed from the sealing body. Between the resin sealing step and the lead plating step, an inspection step for detecting defective products in the resin sealing step and a defective product removal step for removing a device region of defective products are provided.
