feat: Finalize development session and update design documents

This commit concludes the current development session for PatentFinder v3.2.

Key achievements in this session:
- Established a robust, testable architecture by fully separating UI and core logic.
- Implemented a test-driven approach using a dedicated script (`tests/test_sql_search_logic.py`) to stabilize the BigQuery search functionality.
- Resolved persistent SQL generation errors and improved error handling in the `bq_client`.
- The core search workflow, from conversational query to ranked results, is now stable and functional within the Streamlit application.

This commit also includes:
- A detailed session summary (`docs/session_summaries/20250727-220000.md`) documenting the debugging process and key learnings.
- An updated system design guide (`docs/DesignGuide3.2_v4.md`) reflecting the current architecture and future roadmap.
