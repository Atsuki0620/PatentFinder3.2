#### 2. 「主語固定」戦略が以前の検索と比較してどの程度有効だったか
「主語固定」の戦略は逆浸透膜という非常に具体的なテーマに焦点を絞ることはできましたが、ここでの目的は機械学習を用いた運転最適化という非常に特定の適用を見つけることにあります。検索結果は逆浸透関連のアプローチを含むものの、機械学習を組み込んだ最適化システムには至っていません。従って、述語の部分が不足しているため、この戦略は完全には成功していません。

#### 結論
調査の意図にマッチした特許を抽出することはできませんでした。提示された特許の多くは逆浸透膜や水処理に関係しているものの、機械学習を活用した運転最適化に言及しているものは一つもありませんでした。この検索戦略は逆浸透膜に焦点を絞る点では有効であるが、必要な述語の部分（機械学習／制御システム）を引き出すことには不十分であることが明らかです。
