### [5] JP-2024012249-A
- **タイトル:** Musical notation and musical score thereof
- **要約:** To provide a musical score that solves the problem that although there are staff notation and tablature available as two types of musical scores used for a stringed instrument such as a guitar, the staff notation does not specify a style of rendition and never serves as means to transmit the style of rendition to a beginner etc., and the tablature shows only entries of the style of rendition to make a player unaware of what tune being played, namely, it cannot be known what style of rendition is with the staff notation and it cannot be known what tune is being played with the tablature.SOLUTION: Pitch names or syllable names are entered directly into the six lines or four lines of tablature, as shown in Fig.6, Fig.7 and Fig.8, and key signatures, accidentals, etc., are also used when necessary. A style of rendition can be grasped although it is difficult to grasp it with the staff notation, and the pitch names or syllable names also can be grasped although it is difficult to grasp them with the tablature. Musical notion with moving &#34;do&#34; provides musical notion accompanied by analysis of complicated melodies and chords as evolutionary effect.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 12
